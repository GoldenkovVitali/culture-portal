  Culture Portal: Theater directors of Belarus
</h1>

The Culture Portal is a website whose main purpose is to provide information about the life and work of Belarusian theater directors Each page with info about a director has a biography in the form of a timeline, list of artist's works with the date of creation, photo gallery with author's picture or pictures of his/her works, place of author's major activity on a map. All the content are stored in Contentful CMS and requested via GraphQL. So you don't need to deploy the website each time you add a new page with the new director, you just need to add all needed content to Contentful and that's all.
